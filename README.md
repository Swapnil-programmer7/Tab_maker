# Tab_maker
Hello and welcome to Tabulator for Ukulele or TabMaker for short.
This is a c++ based program that efficiently converts user inputs into the required tablature, with accurate sequencing of chords and the spaces in between.
The resulting output is easy to read and follows the conventional format for tablature.
The code can be easily altered to make it worthwhile for other string musical instruments like Guitar or Banjo.
